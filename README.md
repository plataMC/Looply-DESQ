## Getting Started
You need to have an account to access its features. All of its features are free. This is my passion project and I don't like charging people. 
### Sign Up / Register
To have an account, click on the **‘Sign Up’** button. Depending on your preferences, you can either sign up manually via email or sign up using your google email.

### Sign In / Login
If you already have an account with Looply, you do not need to sign up using the same email. Instead, click on the **‘Sign In’** or **‘Log In’** button and proceed with your already existing email.

### Forgot Password
If you cannot remember your password, click on the **‘Forgot Password’** in the Sign In section. 
You will be prompted to enter your email for verification purposes. Once you receive the verification code, you shall be able to reset your password.

## App Features
### Homepage
After log in, you will be directed to the Home page by default. This page lists your outputs or results from the Pricings page.

### Materials
For every material you physically have, it is suggested to add it in the Materials page. You should be able to add new material and view your material details upon successful save. The list of materials will be used during calculations in the Pricings section.

### Pricing
There are ways to price your crafts. If you plan to sell 1 item only, then choose the ‘Single Item’ option. If you have a bulk item and would like to sell it as a whole or get a price for each item, choose the ‘Bulk Item’ option. Future updates or versions will include more pricing options for users to choose from. The more users and feedback, the more pricing options to be considered.
